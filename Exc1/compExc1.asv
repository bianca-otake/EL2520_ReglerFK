%% Exercise 4.1.1. 
% Use the procedure introduced in the basic course to construct a leadlag
% controller which eliminates the static control error for a step response in the reference
% signal.

s = tf('s')
G = 3*(1-s)/((5*s + 1)*(10*s+1));

% The phase margin should be 30deg at the cross-over frequency wc = 0.4 rad/s.

% Lead-lag parameters
K = 1;
beta  = 0;
gamma = 0;
tauD = 1;
tauI = 0;
% lead-lag link
F =
